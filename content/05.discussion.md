## Discussion

After this overview of the current "`vg`" options, it is clear that more needs to be done to make it a useful solution for the community.
For example, we are assuming that we have annotations of the different haplotypes in the pangenome.
There is still no clear solution to lift annotations from one reference/haplotype to other haplotypes, except through reanalysis/reannotation of each haplotype.
Another limitation is that the annotation information is currently reduced to a single label. 
For many annotations, it would be useful to keep the metadata organized, so that the user can access/use it within visualization tools.
Overall, we are also in need for visualization tools that can efficiently layout and organize many *paths* through a pangenome.


- No metadata recorded, all in one path name.
- Simplistic handling of clipped paths.
- Optimized for short paths/ranges.
- Requires ordered integer node IDs for best
performance
